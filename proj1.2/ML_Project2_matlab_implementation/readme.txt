Matlab implementation of project 1.2, which can be run on both synthetic data
and real world data (with 3 different scales). Both closed form solution and 
gradient descent solution are provided. The m files start with "Proj2_*" are the main programs.


Note: The files implementing Kmeans (including KMeans.m and KMeansInitCentroids.m) which serves as initialization
of the model is adopted from external packages implemented by ChrisMcCormick.
